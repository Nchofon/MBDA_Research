# Evaluating Health Facility Distribution and District-Level Disease Prevalence in Rwanda: A Data-driven Approach.
Access to healthcare is a fundamental right, yet disparities in healthcare facility distribution persist in Rwanda. Current resource allocation primarily considers population density rather than actual healthcare needs, leading to inefficiencies in service delivery. This research examines the alignment between healthcare facility distribution and disease prevalence, focusing on Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and HIV. Using geospatial analysis, machine learning, and data from national surveys, this study evaluates whether healthcare resources meet regional demands. By integrating disease prevalence data into resource allocation models, the research proposes a data-driven strategy to optimize healthcare distribution, ensuring equitable access and improved health outcomes in Rwanda.
